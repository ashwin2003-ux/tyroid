Abstract :
In the realm of medical image analysis, the application of deep learning techniques has gained significant attention for thyroid cancer detection and classification, specifically when leveraging ultrasound images.
This research explores the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid cancer diagnosis. By analysing ultrasound images.These advanced models exhibit the capacity to discriminate between benign and malignant thyroid nodules, ultimately contributing to early and more precise detection, crucial for improved patient outcomes and clinical decision-making.
This study encapsulates the fusion of cutting-edge technology with medical diagnostics, showcasing the transformative potential of deep learning in the field of thyroid cancer detection and classification over ultrasound images.
